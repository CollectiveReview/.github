# Collective Science
## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction
We collectively investigate about science ecosystem.

"**Science Ecosystem**" refers to the interconnected network of individuals, institutions, and processes that collectively contribute to the production, dissemination, and application of scientific knowledge. This includes elements like researchers, funding bodies, academic institutions, scientific journals, peer review processes, industry, policy makers, and the general public.

A better Science Ecosystem can be achieved through the collaborative interplay of disciplines like Science of Science, MetaScience, Decentralized Science, Science Philosophy, Social Science, Bibliometrics, Citizen Sciene, among numerous others.

## üåà Contribution guidelines
We're excited that you're considering contributing to our work. This project thrives because of the energy and dedication of our contributors. Before jumping in, let's go over some guidelines that will ensure a smooth and productive collaboration.

1. **Be Respectful**: We prioritize creating an open and inclusive environment for everyone. Therefore, we enforce a policy of absolute respect. Rudeness, offensive comments, or any form of harassment will not be tolerated. Always keep the discussion focused on the task at hand, and remember that everyone is here to learn and grow.

2. **Communication**: Clear communication is key. If you're uncertain about anything, don't hesitate to ask. When discussing issues or providing feedback, be constructive and provide as much context and detail as possible. It's okay to have disagreements, but always ensure they are about the ideas, not the people.

3. **Start Small**: If you're new to the project, it's a good idea to start with smaller tasks. There are always "good first issues" labelled in our issue tracker, perfect for getting your feet wet.

4. **Stay Focused**: Keep your contributions focused on resolving the issue at hand. If you find a new issue during your work, it's usually best to file a new issue report rather than expanding the scope of your current work.

5. **Make Clean, Single-Purpose Commits**: Make sure each commit you send represents a single change that achieves a single purpose. This makes it easier for others to review your changes.

6. **Concise Pull Request**: Once you're ready to share your changes, create a [_pull request_](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). In your pull request description, explain what the changes do and attach references if possible. If your pull request fixes an existing issue, be sure to mention it.

Remember, everyone you're working with is a volunteer! Patience and kindness go a long way. We're all here to learn, grow, and help where we can. Thank you for becoming a part of our community!
